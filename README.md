## Hangman Rules
* Your objective is to guess the hidden word, one letter at a time
* You have a limited amount of guesses before losing the game.
* Each letter you guess correctly, will be displayed in the correct position in the hidden word.
* Each incorrect guess results in another part being added to the hangman figure, representing the remaining guesses

## Installation process
* The user should create a folder on their local machine called hangman (or anything they'd like)
* They should open that folder on their task file and type cmd where the folder path is located.
* Once you've been redirected to the command prompt, you should type "npx create-react-app hangman" which creates the app for you.
* Once created, navigate to the new folder within the one you created.
* Within that folder, you will find an src file, open it paste the Hangman.css, Hangman.js, HangmanWord.js, HangmanButtons.js, HangmanStatus.js, and Words.js files into that folder.
* Alter the App.js file to look exactly like the App.js file within this folder.
* Once complete, return to the command prompt and type "npm start"
* The user will then be redirected to a webpage on a new tab where the game will be displayed and they can play.
